          1. To begin, choose a calculation type (e.g. Addition) and then a
          difficulty (e.g. Easy).
          <br><br><br></br>
          2. The game display will appear, which shows the time you have remaining,
          the difficulty chosen, the question to be answered and your answer
          submission area.
          <br><br><br></br>
          3. To answer questions, simply type your answers in the green answer area,
          using the buttons - you have unlimited tries, but limited time.
          <br><br><br></br>
          4. If you answer correctly, the game display will flash green, the answer
          area will be emptied and a brand new question will appear.
          <br><br><br></br>
          5. You have 30 seconds to answer as many questions correctly as you can.
          Once time runs out, your score will be saved. You will then be able to
          go back to the home page, play again (with the same difficulty) or
          change difficulty.
