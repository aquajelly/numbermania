          1. To begin, choose a calculation type (e.g. Addition, Multiplication etc).
        </p>
        <p class="intro whiteText">
          2. Then, choose a difficulty (Easy, Medium or Hard) - the harder the difficulty, the larger the numbers used.
        </p>
        <p class="intro">
          3. The game display will appear, which shows the time you have remaining, the calculation type you have chosen, the difficulty chosen, the question to be answered and your answer submission area.
        </p>
        <p class="intro whiteText">
          4. To answer questions, simply enter your answers in the green answer area, using the buttons. For example: to type in an answer of 12, click the number 1 and then the number 2. You have unlimited tries, but limited time.
        </p>
        <p class="intro">
          5. If your answer is correct, the game display will flash green, the answer area will be emptied and a brand new question will appear.
        </p>
        <p class="intro whiteText">
          6. Answer that question correctly to get a new question, and keep on answering!
        </p>
        <p class="intro">
          7. You have 30 seconds to answer as many questions correctly as you can. Once time runs out, your score will be saved. You will then be able to go back to the home page, play again (with the same difficulty) or change difficulty.
